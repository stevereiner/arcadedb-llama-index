Advanced usage example for ArcadeDB PropertyGraphStore integration.

This example demonstrates:
1. Custom schema definition and validation
2. Advanced querying techniques
3. Performance optimization with SQL
4. Graph traversal and relationship mapping
5. Integration with existing GraphRAG applications

Requirements:
- ArcadeDB server running on localhost:2480
- ArcadeDB Python client: pip install arcadedb-python
- LlamaIndex ArcadeDB integration: pip install llama-index-graph-stores-arcadedb
- LlamaIndex: uv pip install llama-index-core llama-index-embeddings-openai llama-index-llms-openai
